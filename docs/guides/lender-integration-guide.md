# Lender Integration Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to integrate your lending platform with Fin-Agentix India. By integrating with us, you gain access to a pre-screened, risk-assessed pipeline of loan applications across 12 different sectors.

## Integration Steps

1.  **Partnership Agreement**: Sign a partnership agreement with Fin-Agentix India.
2.  **API Key Provisioning**: Receive secure API keys for our staging and production environments.
3.  **API Integration**: Integrate your system with our REST APIs for receiving loan applications and sending status updates.
4.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test the integration in our staging environment.
5.  **Go-Live**: Once testing is complete, you can go live and start receiving loan applications.

## API Integration

Our APIs are built on REST principles and use JSON for data exchange. All endpoints require authentication using a JWT token.

### Key Endpoints for Lenders

*   `GET /api/v1/applications`: Retrieve a list of new loan applications that match your lending criteria.
*   `GET /api/v1/applications/:id`: Retrieve the full details of a specific loan application, including the applicant's profile, KYC documents, and our AI-powered risk assessment.
*   `PUT /api/v1/applications/:id/status`: Update the status of a loan application (e.g., approved, rejected, pending).

### Webhooks

We use webhooks to provide real-time updates on the status of loan applications. You will need to provide us with a secure webhook URL to receive these updates.

## Risk Assessment

For each loan application, we provide a comprehensive risk assessment score. This score is generated by our AI-powered risk engine, which analyzes over 500 data points, including:

*   Credit bureau data
*   Bank statement analysis
*   GST data (for businesses)
*   Alternative data (e.g., UPI transactions, utility payments)

This allows you to make faster, more informed lending decisions.
